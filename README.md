Existing Attendance System:

	Existing attendance management system is manual, in which everything has to be maintained with the manual process.

	Attendance record is maintained in register, book, file, etc. Then the record is placed in cup board or locker.

	These records have to be kept safe and secure without being lost or damaged.

	So, a secure and safe place is required to keep these records, so that no any liquid substance or any animal like mouse, etc. could harm these data. Generally, they are stored in cup boards. 

	For example, if someone has marked attendance on register, and unfortunately a register has come in contact with water or any liquid substance or any animal like mouse, it will lose the data which is stored in register.

	And if anyone has to check attendance record, then he or she has to find the register first, then he or she can access it.

	If we have to find any specific student’s record, then it’s very difficult to find it in register.
